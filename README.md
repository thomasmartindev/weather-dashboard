# Weather Dashboard

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this project gives users access to real-time, location specific weather data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/). 

Users can simply search for their location at the top of the page and are then presented with a 5-day forcast along with some additional information about the current day. 

The data can be shown in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
